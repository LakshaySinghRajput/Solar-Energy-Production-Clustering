# Solar-Energy-Production-Clustering
This project focuses on clustering geographical areas based on their total solar energy production. The goal is to identify high-potential solar zones that can guide future investments, optimize resource allocation, and support data-driven business decisions in the renewable energy sector.

From the beginning I saw this project not just as a machine learning task but as a real business challenge that needs clarity and purpose I started by spending time with the data understanding how solar energy is being produced across different zones and how various features relate to each other I did not want to just find patterns I wanted to understand what those patterns mean for the company

During the modeling phase I was thinking from the point of view of someone working in the solar energy industry My goal was to create clusters that make sense in real life not just in numbers I explored different algorithms and selected the one that gave meaningful groupings that could help in planning and decision making The visualizations especially the energy zone maps were created to clearly show the output in a way that even a non technical person could understand

Throughout the project I imagined how this analysis would be used in the real world like helping companies choose the best locations for future solar projects or manage their current zones more efficiently I kept the process clean and simple so that it can be adapted into a production system later on My focus was always on creating something that can lead to better decisions smarter investments and real improvement in the business
